## What is DoPlayDo?

DoPlayDo is a platform that makes it easy to post tutorials

## Motivation

Say you want to post a tutorial and make it avalable to other people.

The first step is to start reading up installation manuals and configuring the a web server. Web apps today
use multiple package managers, languages and frameworks making this process very tedious and complicated.

Once the software is installed, DNS and SSL certificates have to be setup. If the server hosts
multiple apps, one needs to make sure that apps do not interfere with each other, setup a
reverse proxy and configure the firewall.

Installation is just one hurdle though. The server and apps must be secured and backed up
properly. Upstream releases must be tracked and updates must be applied on time.

As you can see, self-hosting web applications is error prone and time consuming. 1-click installers
and docker files automate some of the above tasks but requires one to have the technical know how to
complete the installation and put in the effort to keep it up-to-date.

We, at DoPlayDo, want to fix just that!

Now You can just fork the original repo from DoPlayDo, build your tutorial, then you send a pull request with your tutorial included.

If we like your tutorial it would be added to the tutorials available.
